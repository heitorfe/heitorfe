## Data Science Projects

### Sales Predict - Rossmann Store
*  **Business Problem**: The CEO of a drugstore chain wants to make some renovations on some stores. But he wants to know first the budget to make these investments.
*  **Solution**: Develop Machine Learning model to predict how much the stores will sell in the next six weeks. The model will be deployed in production and will be integrated with an API to be resquested by Telegram. So the CEO can request the prediction on his smartphone.
*  **Conclusion**: The model generates a dataframe with the prediction of each store and the respectives worst and best scenarios. The CFO now can know the budget available to renovate the stores, with 90% accuracy.
*  **Git Repository**: https://github.com/heitorfe/rossman-sales-predict



### Propensity Score Rank - Health Insurance Cross Sell
*  **Business Problem**: The business team wants to get the highest precision possible to get new clients with the investment, using cross-sell strategy.
*  **Solution**: Using Machine Learning model get propensity score of each client (Learn to rank). The user has an Google Sheets with API to sort new contact list based on their propensity to buy.
*  **Conclusion**: Calling 20.000 of the test base, the company would reach 80% of the interested. The costs to reach those 80% of interested would be decreased 67% relative to random call.

### Client Churn Prediction - TopBank Company
*  **Business Problem**: Marketing team wants to run a clustering program, but they know nothing about data science. The most valuable customers will be called Insiders.
*  **Solution**: Building a Machine Learning model to do clustering and creating data visualization using Metabase to report clusters metrics.
*  **Conclusion**: Insiders are few but great customers. They have a good participation of the company revenue. Now, marketing can make custom actions to each cluster and work on their retention.
